# Engine-Fault-Prediction
Defect detection in Air Pressure system (APS) of a truck.

Data Description:-

The dataset consists of data collected from heavy Scania trucks in everyday usage. The system in focus is the Air Pressure system (APS) which generates pressurised
air that are utilized in various functions in a truck,such as braking and gear changes. The datasets' positive class consists of component failures
for a specific component of the APS system. The negative class consists of trucks with failures for components not related to the APS. The data consists of a subset of all available data, selected by experts.
The attribute names of the data have been anonymized for proprietary reasons.Â 
Apart from training files, we also require a "schema" file from the client, which contains all the relevant information about the training files such as:
Name of the files, Length of Date value in FileName, Length of Time value in FileName, Number of Columns, Name of the Columns, and their datatype.
